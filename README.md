# digiZest-Hackathon 1.0
This repository consists a part of the project that we worked on in the Digizest Hackathon 1.0. We built a Smart Home Automation system that could detect the presence of a known person in the house and turn on the appliances at home according to the saved preferences of the person. It would also turn it off when there's no one agt home. This code is a small part of it.
